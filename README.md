# My Reading
Attempt at a new method to track reading.

**Purpose:** Learn new techniques, and GitHub native features. Build automations.
**Goal:** Want as minimal user intervention as possible to track reading. Minimal phone interaction. 
Want all reading data in a singular location 

## Outline
- Create an Issue for each book started (any manual logs covering previous progress go in the body)
- Comment the new page on the date it was reached (with backdating allowable, if necessary)
- Develop an automation via GitHub Actions to scrape the Issues and their comments (and contents) for the info needed
- Create a database with relevant tables (for now: "log" and "books")

> Note: Had previously pursued building an SMS automation but Twilio/Google Voice (for Workspace) put me off. My preferred method in the past was taking photos of pages (and the cover at start/finish), but that became hard to log in a spreadsheet consistently. 

## Future 
- Add a dashboard that updates (How frequently? What should it update?)
- Develop a recommender system
- Pull additional book information and/or details
- Integrate "want to read" feature (migrate from Goodreads)
